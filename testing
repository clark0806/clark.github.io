DNS resolve by /etc/hosts
but if disabled somehow which means no valid in this file for DNS resolve.


Add 'addn-hosts=/etc/hosts' into /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/hosts.conf ( created if doesn't exist )
/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/hosts.conf
addn-hosts=/etc/hosts
2. Restart network service ( actually is dnsmasq service )

bash command
service NetworkManager restart
